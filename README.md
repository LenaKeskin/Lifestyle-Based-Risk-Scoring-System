# Lifestyle-Based Risk Scoring System

This project was developed by a two-person team as an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning case study.
The main goal is to analyze daily lifestyle and behavioral data and demonstrate how supervised learning techniques
can be used to build a data-driven risk scoring and classification system.

The project covers the full pipeline, including data analysis, machine learning, visualization, automation,
web application development, PDF reporting, and containerization.
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.
